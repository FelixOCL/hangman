# hangman
Hangman is just that simple game done with html and javascript / jquery
It's basicly working pretty well, though it has some little flaws, globally generaly works.
	-Nothing really works, other than newgame ( i actually found that it was because I stop alerting my random number, so I left it even if you can actually go and get the word if you follow the code.

#Found bugs:
	-Now, I got it to work ok, (french word, I could try putting an english word file soon) but it does not show the last letter on the game. just congrats.
	- Still the error of all letter found, but you still have to press one my key to "win"
	
Any improvment suggestion or stuff is much appreciated.

Thank you.
