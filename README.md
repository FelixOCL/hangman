# hangman
Hangman is just that simple game done with html and javascript / jquery
It's basicly working pretty well, though it has some little flaws, globally generaly works.

#Found bugs:
	-To start a new game, you have to press 2 times the "nouvelle partie" button.
	-When you win and find a word, you have to press one more time a key so it says that you won.
	
Any improvment suggestion or stuff is much appreciated.

Thank you.
